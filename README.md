## Objective:
Break all the bricks as fast as possible using the bouncing ball and the paddle. When the ball misses the paddle and hits the ground, you lose a life. When all lives are lost, the game ends.

## Controls:
S - Launch the ball
A - Move the paddle left
D - Move the paddle right

## Bricks:
Red - Take 3 hits to break (Strength 3)
Yellow - Take 2 hits to break (Strength 2)
Green - Take 1 hit to break (Strength 1)
Purple - Unbreakable (unless a Thru-ball powerup is used)
Rainbow - Settles on a color and strength once its hit

## Powerups:
Expand - Expands the size of the paddle
Shrink - Shrinks size of the paddle
Double - Doubles the number of balls present
Fast - Increases the speed of the ball
Thru - Allows ball to break any brick in one hit
Grab - Allows paddle to grab ball on contact and relaunch at will

After 10 seconds have passed since the game began, every time the ball hits the paddle, the bricks move down a little, and once they reach the same level as the paddle, the game ends.
